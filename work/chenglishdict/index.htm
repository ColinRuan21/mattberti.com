                <h3>Chenglish Dictionary</h3>
                <p>A Chinese-English dictionary and flash cards app for Chinese language learners.</p>
                <p>In production at <a href="http://chenglishdict.com/">chenglishdict.com</a></p>

                <p>As any learner of Chinese soon discovers, there are <i>a lot</i> of characters to learn. <a href="https://lingua.mtsu.edu/academic/dajun-4thtech.pdf">A 2004 study conducted by Jun Da</a>, a linguist at Middle Tennessee State University, found that there are an astounding 258,852,642 unique Chinese characters in use in classical and modern texts. Luckily for learners of the modern language, only about 8,000 are generally known by fluent speakers; Even better, Jun estimates only 3,500 characters are commonly used in modern texts like newspapers and novels.</p>

                <p>Still, the path to literacy in Chinese is a daunting task. As I myself discovered, learning 3,500 characters is time-consuming and nerve-wracking, especially after your weary eyes have come across that same character a hundred times and you still can't seem to get it saved in your memory bank.</p>

                <p>But the benefits of overcoming this hurdle and achieving bilingualism are huge, impacting longevity and wealth. A landmark study published in the journal <i>Neurology</i> in 2013 found that <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/81/22/1938">bilingualism delays age at onset of dementia</a>. In 2014, The Economist used studies and the principle of compound interest to argue that <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2014/03/11/johnson-what-is-a-foreign-language-worth">learning a second language can potentially add $128,000 to your retirement account</a>.</p>

                <p>As I tell my students, to effectively learn anything requires consistent practice (for example, a little every day), and an efficient way to repetitively expose the brain to new information in a curtailing frequency (in other words, see something less as that information is more concretely memorized). In my classroom we do this using <a href="http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/">Cornell Notes</a> and <a href="http://quizlet.com">Quizlet</a>. For my AP US History students, I created <a href="https://quizlet.com/mrberti/folders/ap-us-history?x=1xqt&i=s1e72">study sets</a> for every learning module in the course. Student feedback consistently rates these flash card sets as the most helpful tool available for them (almost always above my painstakingly-prepared lectures).</p>

                <p>So given what I know about effective learning, I was unhappy to discover that when I set out to learn those 3,500 Chinese characters, there wasn't much available for me to really learn efficiently. Thereafter I built this web app on top of <a href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">the data</a> that powers my favorite Chinese-English Dictionary, <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary">MDBG Chinese Dictionary</a>.</p>

                <p>I started by converting all 91,678 entries of the CC-CEDICT dictionary into MySQL data. I then built <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/tree/master/src">three PHP class objects</a> to manage the data:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/blob/master/src/Zhongwen.php">Zhongwen class</a> to fetch the data</li>
                    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/blob/master/src/User.php">User class</a> to manage the activity of guests and registered members</li>
                    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/blob/master/src/Vocab.php">Vocab class</a> to manage and render personal vocabulary lists compililed by users</li>
                </ol>

                <p>On the front end, I designed the app to be mobile-first since I mostly practice using my phone. The <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/chenglish-dictionary/blob/master/public/assets/css/screen.css">CSS</a> is also designed to be fully responsive for users to use on any screen.</p>
