                <h3>AXRN Animal Crossing Right Now</h3>

                <p>A web app for players of the Nintendo Switch game <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> to inform them what critters are available right now.</p>
                <p><b>In production at <a href="https://axnh.herokuapp.com/">axnh.herokuapp.com</a> | Code at <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/axnh">Github</a></b></p>

                <p>During Coronavirus quarantine, Nintendo released the latest installment of the <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(series)">Animal Crossing series</a>, <i><a href="https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/">New Horizons</a></i>. Players inhabit a tropical island full of endemic wildlife, specifically bugs, fish, and anthropomorphic animal inhabitants. The latter you build relationships (or rivalries) with, while the bugs and fish can be caught and put on display in a delightfully  atmospheric little town museum.</p>

                <p>These critters, however, are only available at certain times of the day or months of the year. I had the idea of a web app that can notify the player which critters are available at the time of playing to help them build up their museums.</p>

                <p>I had also been wanting to learn Python for some time now and took the opportunity of being on lockdown to learn the basics and a web framework. I worked with <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Django</a> at first and loved all the additional features and packages that came with the software. However, I eventually went with <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> because its small footprint was perfect for a simple app like mine.</p>
