                <h3>MERN Issue Tracker</h3>

                <p>An app to track issues on an app, built for learning purposes.</p>
                <p><b>Code on <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker">Github</a></b></p>
                <p>I previously started to learn React and wanted to 
                    enhance my understanding of it while learning other modern frameworks. I used Subramanian&#39;s <a 
                    href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484243909">&quot;Pro MERN Stack&quot;</a> as a primary reference, but 
                    also consulted other sources to make the modifications I desired. Essential sources include <a 
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks documentation</a>, <a 
                        href="https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start">React Router documentation</a>, <a 
                        href="https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/">Material UI documentation</a>, <a 
                        href="https://docs.mongodb.com/">MongoDB documentation</a>, and, of course, Stack Overflow.</p>
                <h4 id="modifications-and-considerations">Modifications and Considerations</h4>
                <p>When building this app I chose to make several architectural changes. I&#39;ve documented the major modifications 
                    below.</p>
                <h5 id="use-of-react-hooks-instead-of-classes">Use of React Hooks instead of classes</h5>
                <p>Subramanian&#39;s code utilizes <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">React component classes</a>.
                    When building my own app, I refactored all classes into more functional <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks</a>. I think the final result is more elegant and
                    concise.</p>
                <p>In order to refactor the classes, I found I had to use these hooks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code> manage state previously handled by <code>this.state</code>.
                        Reducer was especially useful for complex state management, such as the <a
                            href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueEdit.jsx">IssueEdit</a> component that must fetch data, load data into form, track changes
                        on form, and submit changes to API.</li>
                    <li><code>useEffect</code> manages functions that need to opt into the component lifecycle. This was necessary where
                        Subramanian used the class methods <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and
                        <code>componentWillUnmount</code>. For the <a href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueTable.jsx">IssueTable</a> component, I found I
                        needed to combine the side effect hook with a memoized callback (<code>useCallback</code>) to filter the table
                        when the router parameters changed.</li>
                    <li><code>useRef</code> allowed accessing child components in a form imperatively, such as in the <a
                            href="https://github.com/dr-spaceman/mern-issue-tracker/ui/src/IssueAdd.jsx">IssueAdd</a> component where a form was referenced in order to access child input
                        values.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 id="use-of-material-ui-instead-of-bootstrap">Use of Material UI instead of Bootstrap</h5>
                <p>Subramanian made the case for Bootstrap in his book:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Material UI has an interesting CSS-in-JS and inline-style approach of styling that fits well into Reactâ€™s
                        philosophy of isolating everything needed by a component, with the component itself. But this framework is much
                        less popular and seems to be a work in progress. And, perhaps the inline-style approach is too drastic a
                        deviation from convention. React-Bootstrap is a safe alternative that is built on top of the very popular
                        Bootstrap and fits our needs (except for the lack of a date picker).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Despite this argument, I went with Material UI because of curiosity and style preference. Having some experience with
                    Bootstrap previously and keeping consistent with the goal of learning something new, I chose an alternate path. 
                    As I implement Material UI in this app, I want to test how easy
                    it is to implement styled components into my React components, and how easy it is to implement my own custom styles
                    to prevent the app design from looking bland and uniform.</p>
