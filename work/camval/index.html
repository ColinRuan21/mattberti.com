                <h3>Camval Produce</h3>

                <p>Project Lead</p>
                <p><b>In development at <a href="https://www.sandiegoproduce.shop">sandiegoproduce.shop</a></b></p>
                <p>As this was my first single-page web app, I prepared by building <a href="../mern-tracker">Mern Issue Tracker</a> on top of several microservices, then used the technical understanding and boilerplate to develop this e-commerce app.</p>
                <p>The UI is React with Material UI components. I had a great time with React hooks; No class components were harmed in the making of this app!</p>
                <p>I built the GraphQL client from scratch because the app merely requires a simple way to fetch queries and
                mutations from the API. Most of the work is done with two React hooks, <code>useQuery</code> and <code>useMutation</code>, each of 
                which utilize a common fetching process that uses Javascript <code>fetch</code> API while managing the state of the fetch. 
                The client handles errors based on the following maxims <a href="https://itnext.io/the-definitive-guide-to-handling-graphql-errors-e0c58b52b5e1" title="The Definitive Guide to Handling GraphQL Errors">described by Matt Krick</a>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If GraphQL gives you a result with data, even if that result contains errors, it is not an error.</li>
                    <li>If the viewer should see the error, include the error as a field in the response payload</li>
                </ul>
