Your old, tired, stale, rotting, useless, vapid necro-accounts on the internet may be a personal security threat were the account to be breached. A great tool for deleting those accounts is [justdelete.me](https://justdelete.me). It's even [open source](https://github.com/justdeleteme/justdelete.me)!

On a related note, I recently made the switch from LastPass to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com). <!-- more --> LastPass suddenly imposed a paywall and I felt slighted by the change of policy; And Bitwarden made it super easy to import my passwords. In the process of looking for a new password manager I tried out Dashlane, too. Although it has a slick UI, Dashlane at $40/year was not as economical as Bitwarden, free/forever. There are good reasons to choose Bitwarden besides:

- Protects user passwords with 256-bit AES encryption, [virtually unbreakable](https://www.atpinc.com/blog/what-is-aes-256-encryption) with today's computing power
- Open source, active community, extensive scrutiny
- Free option is fine!
- Actively adding new features like [Bitwarden Send](https://bitwarden.com/products/send/)

Anyway, after deciding on Bitwarden, I revisited Dashlane to delete my account, but to no avail. That feature was hidden somewhere. A quick visit to justdelete.me provided a direct link to the delete process.

___Note to self___ Use new Bitwarden account to find other necro-accounts, then smite them with justdelete.me
